          <h4>Year 1 (2025)</h4>
          <p>In the first year, my primary focus will be on advancing my backend development skills. I will complete my current course and work on several projects to gain hands-on experience with server-side programming, databases, and API integration. Concurrently, I will apply for and enroll in the CyberSafe Fellowship to learn Penetration Testing. This will involve dedicating time to studying cybersecurity principles, tools, and techniques. I will also attend workshops, webinars, and industry conferences to network with professionals and stay updated on the latest trends. By the end of the year, I aim to be proficient in both backend development and penetration testing.</p>

        <div class="w-100">
          <h4>Year 2 (2026)</h4>
          <p>In the second year, I will focus on integrating my frontend and backend skills to work as a Full Stack Developer. I will undertake complex projects that require a combination of these skills, ensuring I can seamlessly handle both aspects of web development. Additionally, I will continue my cybersecurity education, applying the penetration testing knowledge gained from the CyberSafe Fellowship in real-world scenarios. By mid-year, I will start researching and preparing applications for a masterâ€™s degree in CyberSecurity in the United States. This includes studying for necessary exams, gathering recommendation letters, and writing personal statements to strengthen my applications.</p>
